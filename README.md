# Logstash-eco-game-log-parser
Logstash config files for ELK indexation 
Keep in mind this is a very work in progress repository and there is a good chance a will never fully finish it.
It is just here becase I think parsing logs from  eco game is quiet anoying (mostly because of html tags) and I want to share what I've donne, feel free to replicate and anhance it !
